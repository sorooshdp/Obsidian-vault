Manchester encoding is a digital data encoding method where each bit is represented by a voltage transition in the middle of a bit period. A '1' is encoded as a high-to-low transition, while a '0' is encoded as a low-to-high transition. This mid-bit transition provides inherent clock synchronization for the receiver, eliminating the need for a separate clock signal. Additionally, Manchester encoding ensures that the encoded signal has no DC component, making it suitable for AC-coupled transmission systems like Ethernet. This technique has been used in various applications, including early Ethernet standards, magnetic stripe cards, and RFID.
