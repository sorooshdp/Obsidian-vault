A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is not a finished piece of code but rather a blueprint or template that can be customized to solve a recurring design problem in a specific context. Unlike algorithms, which define precise steps to achieve a goal, design patterns provide a high-level description of how to structure code or system components to address particular challenges effectively[1](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/what-is-pattern)[2](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

Typically, a design pattern description includes several parts:

- **Intent**: What problem the pattern addresses and the essence of the solution.
- **Motivation**: Explanation of the problem and how the pattern solves it.
- **Structure**: Diagram or description of the classes or objects involved and their relationships.
- **Code example**: Sample implementation in a programming language to illustrate the pattern[1](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/what-is-pattern).

Design patterns are broadly categorized into three types:

- **Creational patterns** (e.g., Singleton, Factory Method) that deal with object creation mechanisms.
- **Structural patterns** that ease the design by identifying simple ways to realize relationships between entities.
- **Behavioral patterns** that manage algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects[2](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns)[10](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/what-are-design-patterns-understanding-the-basics/).
