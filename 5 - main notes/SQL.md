SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It's designed to handle data stored in tables, where each row represents a record, and each column represents a field. Here’s a breakdown based on academic sources:

1. **Purpose of SQL**: SQL is primarily used to perform operations like querying, updating, inserting, and deleting data in databases. It’s also used for managing the structure of the database itself, such as creating or modifying tables and setting permissions.

2. **Relational Databases**: SQL works with relational databases, where data is organized into tables. Each table has a set of columns (attributes) and rows (records). The relational model ensures that the relationships between data in different tables can be easily managed using SQL.

3. **Key Operations**:
   - **SELECT**: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
   - **INSERT**: Adds new records into a table.
   - **UPDATE**: Modifies existing records.
   - **DELETE**: Removes records.
   - **CREATE/DROP**: Defines or removes tables and other structures.

4. **Data Integrity**: SQL allows for constraints (rules) that ensure data accuracy and reliability, such as primary keys (unique identifiers for each record) and foreign keys (links between records in different tables).

5. **Transaction Control**: SQL supports managing transactions, which are sequences of operations that must either all succeed or all fail. This ensures the integrity of the database, even in cases like power failures or crashes.

6. **SQL Standards**: SQL has several versions standardized by organizations like the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Most modern database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server support SQL with some system-specific extensions.
