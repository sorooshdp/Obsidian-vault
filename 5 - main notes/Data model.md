data model: a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints. The data models can be classified into four different categories: 
- *Relational Model*: There relational model uses a collection of tables to represent both data and the relationships among those data. Each table has multiple columns, and each column has a unique name. Tables are also known as *relations*.
- Entity-Relationship Model. The entity-relationship (E-R) data model uses a collection of basic objects, called entities, and relationships among these objects. An entity is a “thing” or “object” in the real world that is distinguishable from other objects.
- Semi-structured Data Model. The semi-structured data model permits the specification of data where individual data items of the same type may have different sets of attributes.
The collection of information stored in the database at a particular moment is called an *instance* of the database. The overall design of the database is called the database *schema*.
