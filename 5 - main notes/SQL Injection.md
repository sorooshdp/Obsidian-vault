SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that allows attackers to manipulate and execute malicious SQL statements within a web application's database. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the way an application processes user input, an attacker can alter SQL queries to bypass authentication mechanisms, retrieve unauthorized data, or even modify the database. This attack targets web applications that directly execute user input as part of SQL queries without proper validation or sanitization.
