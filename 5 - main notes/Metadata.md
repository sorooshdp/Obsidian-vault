In web development, **metadata** is data that provides information about your webpages. It's not visible on the page itself but is embedded within the `<head>` section of the HTML. This behind-the-scenes information is crucial for search engines and social media platforms to understand your page's content [1](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-metadata).

Properly configured metadata is essential because it:
- **Improves SEO**: Helps search engines like Google effectively index your pages and improve their ranking in search results [1](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-metadata)[6](https://clerk.com/blog/how-to-customize-nextjs-metadata).
- **Enhances Shareability**: Platforms like Facebook and Twitter use **Open Graph metadata** to create appealing, informative previews when your links are shared [](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-metadata)[](https://clerk.com/blog/how-to-customize-nextjs-metadata).
- **Ensures a Good User Experience**: It helps display page titles correctly in browser tabs and ensures your site looks good on all devices [](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-metadata)[](https://blogs.purecode.ai/blogs/nextjs-head).
