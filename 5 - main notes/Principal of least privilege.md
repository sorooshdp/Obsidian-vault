- The principle of least privilege requires that users and processes be given only the bare minimum privileges needed to perform their intended functions. 
- Benefits of the principle include improved intellectual security, better system security, and easier deployment of applications. 
- Implementing the principle in practice is challenging due to the difficulty of precisely defining the minimum set of privileges required by a process. 
- The principle has been traced back to early implementations in Unix login.c and is a core concept in trusted computing base (TCB) minimization.
