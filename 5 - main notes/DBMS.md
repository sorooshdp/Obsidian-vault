A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient. Managing complexity is challenging, not only in the management of data but in any domain. Key to the management of complexity is the concept of `abstraction`. two modes in which databases are used:
- online transaction processing,
- data analytics
*file-processing system*: The system stores permanent records in various files, and it needs different application programs to extract records from, and add records to, the appropriate files. disadvantages:
- Data redundancy and inconsistency
- Difficulty in accessing data
- Data isolation
- Integrity problems
- Atomicity problems
- Concurrent-access anomalies
- Security problems
