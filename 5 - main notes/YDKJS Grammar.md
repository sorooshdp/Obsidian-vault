A "sentence" is one	complete	formation of words	that expresses	a thought. It's comprised of one	or	more "phrases," each of	which can be connected	with	punctuation	marks or conjunction words	("and,"	"or,"	etc).	A	phrase	can	itself	be	made	up	of	smaller	phrases. Some phrases are incomplete and don't	accomplish	much	by	themselves,	while	other phrases	can stand on their	own. These	rules are	collectively	called	the	grammar	of	the English	language. And	so	it	goes	with	JavaScript	grammar.	Statements	are sentences, expressions	are phrases,	and	operators are conjunctions/punctuation.

It's a fairly little known fact that statements all have completion values (even if that value is just `undefined`)
